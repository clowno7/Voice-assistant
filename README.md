Building a voice assistant for the following problem statement: Finding the Best Deal on High Demand Drops

Problem statment: 
When trying to buy limited-edition sneakers or concert tickets, it’s hard to know who’s offering the 
best price or fastest delivery. Resellers often have different prices and offers, and users don’t have 
time to compare everything. Your task is to build a voice AI agent that can speak with resellers, track 
and negotiate prices, compare options, and help the user choose the best deal.

Working on!!

Gonna bring it with great UI
